    <img src="quesadilla.jpg">
    <p>It's easy, it's quick, it's delicious, it's nutritious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese or cheese substitute</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas (or flour if you insist)</li>
        <li>Any toppings you want</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Oh yeah, fire up a pan on low-med heat, no oil!</li>
        <li>Put your tortillas in the pan with your bare hands, don't be a wuss</li>
        <li>After about a minute, flip the tortillas over, and place all the cheese on one side (make sure it's not so much that you wouldn't be able to fold it later)</li>
        <li>If you have any vegetables or whatever you like, add them as well</li>
        <li>Fold the other half on top of the cheese and stuff, then flip</li>
        <li>Flip a couple times over the span of a minute or two, until the cheese melts</li>
        <li>Serve up some salsa or just go at them caveman style, like I do. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
